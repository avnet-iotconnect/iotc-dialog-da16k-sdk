This folder contains overrides to core SDK files to add 
support for IoT Connect Console and AT Commands, as well
as new additional files related to them to support IoTC code.

This is done to avoid shipping the SDK directory structure.

IoTConnect Azure Discovery/ID throws out some obscenely long 
user names. The default limit of 64 characters for the username
length does not suffice. So we provide overrides for these two
files as well:

core/system/src/mqtt_client/mqtt_client.c
core/system/include/mqtt_client/mqtt_client.h

The header file includes the new limit (256 chars)

There is a bug in the mosquitto client implementation for DA16K
which causes the mosquitto main loop to miss message sends
when DPM mode is disabled due to lack of synchronization between
the send function and the loop. The send function won't wait
for the main loop to catch up before queueing another message.
So we provide overrides for mosquitto.c and sub_client.c 
to fix this.
